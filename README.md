In order to test the code starting from a project already capable of running the most basic version you must:
1. Paste all .java files into the java src folder in the server code

2. paste the resources folder, image files and sound files into the build folder of the clientside code

3. paste the .cpp and .h files into the src folder of the client side code

There has been a server side code folder included that may be usable instead of step one for running, however I cannot test this on a different machine
